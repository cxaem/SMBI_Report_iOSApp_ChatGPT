# Introduction
The advent of artificial intelligence applications such as the ChatGPT App by OpenAI has sparked a revolution in communication, resulting in an exponential increase in data generation. As AI integrates more deeply into our lives, the management of data and its privacy have emerged as critical issues. As a response, enhancements to the ChatGPT App were made, particularly the introduction of chat history management, offering users the much-needed control over their data.

# Problem to Solve
The central question that this project aims to tackle is: "How did the introduction of chat history management features in the ChatGPT App (release 1.2023.23) influence user sentiment as seen in the App Store reviews available until June 25, 2023?"

# Hypothesis
In light of the rising data privacy and management concerns, we anticipate that the introduction of chat history management features in release 1.2023.23 would have been received positively, resulting in a noticeable shift in user sentiment in reviews related to data privacy.
