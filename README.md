# Abstract
In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence, the introduction of the ChatGPT App by OpenAI marked a significant milestone. But, as with all great innovations, it opened up new questions, particularly around data privacy and management. That's where the chat history management feature came in, aiming to put the power back in the users' hands.

Our study, which you could say was a bit of a scientific adventure, sought to gauge the impact of this feature on user sentiment, as seen through the lens of App Store reviews. We hypothesized a standing ovation, particularly concerning data privacy. However, as we ventured into the data, sentiment analysis revealed a plot twist: a decrease in positive sentiments and an uptick in negative and neutral ones post-release.

The story continued with a decrease in polarity and subjectivity, signaling a shift towards more negative, fact-based discourse. The rating analysis added another layer, uncovering a decline in average ratings and a dip in higher ratings.

In the final act, our findings painted a picture that was not quite the fairy tale ending we anticipated. The new feature may not have hit the mark as hoped, especially in the realms of data privacy and management. What this tale underscores is the paramount importance of staying tuned to user feedback and being nimble in making adjustments. In the grand theater of AI and data privacy, it's all about keeping the audience engaged and trusting, one act at a time.

So, sit back, grab some popcorn, and join us as we explore this intricate dance between innovation, user experience, and the ever-important trust. It's science, but with a twist!

# Introduction
The advent of artificial intelligence applications such as the ChatGPT App by OpenAI has sparked a revolution in communication, resulting in an exponential increase in data generation. As AI integrates more deeply into our lives, the management of data and its privacy have emerged as critical issues. As a response, enhancements to the ChatGPT App were made, particularly the introduction of chat history management, offering users the much-needed control over their data.

# Problem to Solve
The central question that this project aims to tackle is: "How did the introduction of chat history management features in the ChatGPT App (release 1.2023.23) influence user sentiment as seen in the App Store reviews available until June 25, 2023?"

# Hypothesis
In light of the rising data privacy and management concerns, we anticipate that the introduction of chat history management features in release 1.2023.23 would have been received positively, resulting in a noticeable shift in user sentiment in reviews related to data privacy.
